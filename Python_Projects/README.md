# Introduction Summary

This project involved analyzing clinical datasets from an AI-driven med tech company focused on cardiovascular imaging. Their work leverages artificial intelligence to improve diagnostic accuracy and enable early detection of coronary artery disease.

My approach began with transforming the raw data—converting JSON files into Excel format for easier handling and exploration. I then performed a detailed analysis of the inclusion, exclusion, and primary datasets to ensure structural consistency and data integrity.

### Key objectives included:

Demographic breakdowns by race, gender, and stenosis severity

Calcium score risk stratification

Evaluation of imaging machine manufacturers’ influence on results

Standardizing race and ethnicity categories in line with FDA guidelines

Through visualizations, tabular summaries, and structured insights, this analysis aimed to support better clinical decision-making, improve study design, and identify representation gaps in the data.

### Skill used for this Project
1. Data Handling with pandas
2. Data Visualization with matplotlib & seaborn
